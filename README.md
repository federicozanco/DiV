Dummy Image Viewer (DiV)
===

Tiny (simple and raw) standalone image viewer written in WPF (Windows Presentation Foundation)
with preview features, supporting .jpg, .png, .gif, .bmp.

Nothing really new but I need it to scan tons of date-ordered snapshots in ladle tracking.

You can find a binary here: ![Download DiV executable](http://www.siorarina.net/div/DummyImageViewer.zip)

Press H for help.

Have fun!
